## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**lyethi/lyethi** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on being the best version of myself 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in learning more about coding and seeing where this new skill could take me 
- ğŸ‘¯ My hobbies include reading, watching movies and shows, cooking, and going on walks (and just moving my body in general)
