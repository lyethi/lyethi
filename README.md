## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Lyethi, and I'm a first-year college student. I'm a management major, with a double minor in psychology and marketing 
I'm currently working on being the best version of myself and getting my BBA
I'm interested in learning more about coding, and I'm excited to see where this new skill could take me 
My hobbies include reading, watching movies and shows, cooking, learning new skills, and going on walks (and moving my body in general)
